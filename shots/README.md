Description
-----------

Each video is pre-segmented using the approach described in **Sec 3.1** of the paper.  The shot indices for each video is described as a txt-file that contains `(nShot+1)` lines.  The `n`-th shot maps the frames of the numbers of the `n`-th line and the `(n+1)-th line of a corresponding txt file.
